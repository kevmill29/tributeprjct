# tributeprjct
Hello, this project is a tribute to Michael Jackson. He is one of my favorite artists of all time and inspires me to work hard with his crazy work ethic. 
I added a picture of his first posthumous album and also some details of his life. 
I created this project using HTML & CSS to add to my portfolio as I start my career in Front End development. 
Usuable with Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge(hopefully if anyone uses it?), and most other browsers although font issues may occur. 
But generally from what I have seen google fonts are websafe. 

Thank you for reading!
